Peevey, in San Francisco. Blattner stated that SDG&E supports Community Choice Aggregation (CCA), but is concerned that language in the Proposed Decision (PD) creates constitutional issues. Specifically, Blattner suggested that PD use the `billing process' language of AB 117. Blattner noted that this should be a mutually beneficial outcome for utilities and community choice aggregators. Blattner also suggested that the marketing prohibition be clarified so that ordinary utility-customer communications that are unrelated to CCA activities are not captured."

Eisenman explained that PG&E supports the implementation of Community Choice Aggregation (CCA).  Burns expressed concerns about the proposed decision's (PD) discussion on the opportunity for CCA to take delivery of a portion of a Department of Water Resources (DWR) contract. Burns added that the cost responsibility surcharge (CRS) is a reflection of the above market component of PG&E's costs, and does not entitle the CCA to delivery of power. Burns also requested that the final order clarify that the $.022/kWh CRS includes only the DWR power charge and CTC.

Also present were Wayne Sakarias, Director of Legislative Analysis, and Billy Blattner, CPUC Relations Manager, for SDG&E. Written materials (attached to the notice) were used. Blattner stated that SDG&E supported AB 117 and supports Community Choice Aggregation (CCA), but it must not conflict with utility resource planning and bundled ratepayers must be protected. Sakarias explained that the proposed decision (PD) conflicts with approved procurement and resource adequacy decisions as well as state law. Sakarias also explained that cost responsibility surcharge (CRS) represents the above-market cost of Department of Water Resources (DWR) power, not the cost of the physical power or capacity. Sakarias stated that determination in the PD that CCAs are entitled to `in-kind' allocation of DWR contracts would result in bundled customers subsidizing free or reduced-cost power to CCA customers. Sakarias expressed concerns about the PD's treatment of confidentiality, phasing in CCA and certain transaction costs, and recommended hat the PD clarify that the CRS does not include the bond charge."

Written material (attached to the notice) was used.  Rubin stated that PG&E is committed to working with potential CCAs and the Commission to fairly implement CCA service.  Burns explained that a customer responsibility surcharge (CRS) needs to be developed so that remaining bundled customers are indifferent to CCA service.  Burns stated that the CRS should reflect all above-market procurement-related costs.  Burns stated that PG&E recommends that CCAs should have a five-year resource adequacy requirement and that a single CRS rate be applicable for all CCA participants and all usage up to 130% of baseline.  Evans outlined PG&E's recommendations on implementation cost recovery and transaction cost recovery."
