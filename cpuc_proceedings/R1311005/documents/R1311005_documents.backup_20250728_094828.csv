The post-presentation discussion was attended by Forest Kaser, advisor to Cmmr. Picker.  Mr. Chien, referring to the three-prong test for fuel substitution programs in this proceeding, stated that the Commission is reviewing the three-pronged test, and that currently, the test generally prevents the use of ratepayer funds to support “fuel substitution” measures, which affects the City’s plans to reduce carbon emissions including from use of fossil fuels for thermal end uses, such as water heating. San Francisco did not make any requests or recommendations with regard to the three-prong test."

Quinn highlighted the ERA Fund’s focus on performance-based solutions using M&V for each participating site. Quinn described how Joule Assets achieves deployment through development of a network of contractor and technology partners; incorporates best practices, such as ICP certification with its projects and incorporates investment-grade backed performance insurance for its portfolio of projects. Quinn noted that the ERA Fund is interested in investing in projects availing of the principles of both SB 350 and AB 802. Joule Assets stated that it has been actively involved in providing input as California Alternative Energy and Advanced Transportation Financing Authority develops credit enhancement programs to support further energy efficiency investment to meet the objectives of SB 350.  Quinn reinforced that timely measurement and verification and baseline methodology development will be key to AB 802 success.

Menten noted that MCE's service territory grew 30% in 2015 and will likely see similar growth in 2016. Menten indicated that the EE Coordinating Committee is an impressive effort that merits a high level of engagement from all parties. Menten described the capacity challenges that are faced by small program administrators, and indicated that the staff of MCE may need to scale back engagement efforts with the EE Coordinating Committee. However, Menten did not believe this would cause concerns because as local government agencies, CCAs are already subject to a variety of rules related to transparency.  Menten voiced concerns on the methodology of ex ante review and indicated an open and transparent forum for saving estimate review offered by the Technical Forum would be a welcome change. Menten further emphasized having CPUC engagement early on in the process will improve both savings estimates and stakeholder engagement."

Taha reminded the Commissioner of their meeting 2 years ago in which she and Eckhart reviewed the barriers facing low and moderate income ratepayers from receiving the best and most innovative conservation programs from other regions where they have been found cost effective and beneficial to these customers.  Taha noted a key element of their success in the northwest was the Regional Technical Forum which they believed would help California address M&V processes which needed to be reworked.  Eckhart shared his observations having served over the past year and a half on the CALTF.  Eckhart stated his concern that the CALTF did not have formal standing and having the CPUC to define technical and policy roles for the Energy Division and Commission representatives could be helpful.  Eckhart observed that without Commission feedback and participation out of state participation from volunteers and experts could diminish."

At the meeting, Nexant briefed on a staff disposition that would deny energy efficiency savings claimed for a Nexant industrial retrocommissioning project. Nexant explained that air compressor projects represent significant energy efficiency savings potential, and it is not industry standard practice to repair air leaks in air compressor systems unless the air compressors are not meeting the customer's end use needs. Nextant further explained that Title 24 is not triggered in this instance and that Staff's characterization of the air compressor project as a ""to code"" project was incorrect.  Nextant also stated that it is prohibited from communicating directly with staff regarding errors in the disposition; and that because Nexant is a third party implementer, and not the Program Administrator, there is no clear process for it to appeal or seek review of the staff disposition."

Goodson specifically discussed governance, oversight, and funding issues related to SB 765.  Goodson also briefly discussed potential changes to the Commission's policies on energy efficiency baselines. Goodson mentioned the importance of considering the totality of interrelated policies that should be revisited in conjunction with baselines, such as assumptions about savings from the Codes and Standards program and inputs into the demand forecast.

Peterman; Jeanne Clinton, Governor's CPUC advisor on energy efficiency; and Steve Schiller, Board Chair Emeritus, for the Efficiency Council.  Efficiency Council's representatives discussed Assembly Bill 1330, a bill currently introduced in the  
California Legislature, which is sponsored by the Efficiency Council.  The Efficiency Council representatives explained that this legislation could work in conjunction with the goal setting process within the proceeding, as it simply establishes a ""floor"" by which energy savings through efficiency must be achieved.  Schiller explained that since energy efficiency is a resource that all Californians can benefit from, the Efficiency Council felt that it was important to ensure disadvantage communities were included in a major way in the state's energy efficiency efforts. A written material (attached to the notice) was used."
