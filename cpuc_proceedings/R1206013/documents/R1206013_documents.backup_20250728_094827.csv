Guzman Acéves. Energy Division staff, Kimberly Rodriguez, Principal Manager of Community and Government Energy Assistance in Customer Programs & Services, Janet Zavala, Manager of Mass Market Demand Response, and Robin Meidhof, Senior Attorney, on behalf of SCE, as well as representatives of San Diego Gas & Electric Company and Pacific Gas and Electric Company also participated in the telephone conference. SCE explained that it supports a common definition of a disadvantaged community across all CPUC proceedings, one that is based on the most up-to-date criteria developed by the California Environmental Protection Agency. SCE explained that currently it does not specifically target or directly market to low-income customers for any of its DR programs, but rather conducts outreach to all customers that are eligible for participation and enrolls those that can benefit from providing DR services. SCE provided a specific example, where at the direction of the Commission, SCE focused outreach for its Summer Discount Plan program in the LA Basin area to help address the Aliso Canyon issue. SCE explained that it has limited data on the subject of how low-income customers may benefit from DR, but believes that opportunities exist for potential synergies between the Energy Efficiency, DR, and low-income proceedings. SCE recommended the Commission direct a study to further gather information on this topic to assist the Energy Division in their preparation of guidelines for the IOUs who have been directed to submit pilot proposals in first quarter 2018.

SCE addressed issues associated with the timing of SCE’s TOU roll-out and CS Re-Platform implementation. SCE discussed the potential Marketing, Education, and Outreach impacts of additional time required for SCE to fully complete the TOU roll-out, and SCE explained how the old and new systems can accommodate customers being transitioned at different times.

SCE also expressed the desire to possibly follow up with the Commission about why default time-of-use disproportionally impacts lower-usage customers owing in part to the Super-User Electric surcharge adopted in Decision 15-07-001."

Picker, in San Francisco.  Also present was Dennis Keane, Chief Rate Analyst, Rates and Regulatory Analytics, PG&E. Dietz stated that the petition to modify to allow an additional two-year grace period for PG&E’s non-residential customers to qualify for grandfathering on time-of-use (TOU) rates with obsolete TOU periods is not required for the health of the solar industry.  Keane described the concept and rationale for limited grandfathering of customers with solar, and noted that Decision 17-01-006 was a reasonable compromise that limited the amount of customer load allowed to be grandfathered on legacy TOU rates with outdated TOU period hours.  Keane noted that PG&E has submitted comments stating it would not object to one additional proposed change to the grandfathering rules which would establish a somewhat-later installation deadline for schools.  Dietz stated that, while PG&E is supportive of this change to the decision, the additional grandfathering requested in the solar groups’ petition for modification is not warranted.  Written materials (attached to the notice) were used."

Campbell noted the ORA's support on the proposed decision's adoption in moving forward with default Time of Use (TOU) rate structure in 2019, but urged the Commission to reject the fixed charges.  Campbell also voiced general support for Cmmr. Florio's tentative alternate decision, which is likely to keep default TOU, replace fixed charges with minimum bills, and adopt a three-tiered end state block rate."

TASC noted that, as set forth in the PD, the tier collapse and its phase-in period will be a challenge for the solar industry. TASC requested that the glidepath to the end state of tier collapse be extended by at least one year, that grandfathering of current enrollees on existing TOU rates be for 20 years instead of 5 years, that the higher minimum bill be a permanent aspect of the reformed residential rate design, and that minimum bills or fixed charges for TOU rates be waived on a temporary basis to encourage retention when TOU rates are made default. TASC also stated that it could support a modest fixed charge as part of rate reforms including establishment or increase of a minimum bill and tier flattening/reduction in tiers to help address recovery of fixed costs as part of the framework.  TASC continues to oppose the significant fixed charges requested by the utilities."

Maria Stamas representing Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC) also participated in these meetings.   Katz and Stamas discussed the significant negative impacts of the utility proposals for a fixed charge and collapsed tier ratios on energy efficiency, conservation, and solar. Representatives also discussed the design and procedural schedule of design of default TOU rates, including the importance for energy efficiency, conservation, and solar PV to design TOU rates with adequate peak rate differentials, and the customer acceptance benefits of a baseline credit component. Copies of the formally filed Joint Reply Brief of Sierra Club and NRDC were provided."

Winn discussed SDG&E's overall vision for SDG&E's rate proposal and   
 addressed the importance of both the fixed charge and reduction of tiers. Prusnek emphasized that certain parties in the proceeding argue that low-income customers are low-usage customers is essentially a truism, the data shows that this is not the case and SDG&E has many high-use, low-income customers who would benefit from its rate proposal.  Fang discussed a variety of elements on SDG&E's Time-of-Use pilot program. A written material (attached to the notice) was used. "
