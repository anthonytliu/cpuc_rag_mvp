Guzman Aceves, in San Francisco. Ms. Brandt discussed the need for the brown-power true up as required by D.18-10-019 to be implemented immediately in the PCIA rate update. Ms. Brandt expressed concern that the Energy Division RA Report that will be used to determine the capacity value in the PCIA benchmark does not reflect enough of the actual market transactions, nor are updates to the report frequent enough. Ms. Brandt suggested that requirements for what the report should include and when it is released may need to be codified in a future ERRA decision since it is used to set rates in the ERRA proceeding. Ms. Brandt further raised concerns about the timing of implementation of the PCIA decision in the ERRA, and about the interpretation of details that will need to be worked out for effective implementation.

Gamson, advisor to Cmmr. Guzman-Aceves, in San Francisco. Ms. Kahl observed that the determination of “indifference” rests on the valuation of the utilities’ portfolios, since Public Utilities Code §366.2(g) requires that the Commission reduce the portfolio cost by “the value of any benefits that remain with bundled service customers.” Ms. Kahl explained that the Alternate Proposed Decision (APD) does not achieve indifference in valuing the bundled utility portfolios and, instead, shifts costs to departing load customers. Ms. Kahl noted that the APD’s attempt to equate the products in the utilities’ portfolios with the benchmark proxies produces a material cost shift to departing load customers. Written material (attached to the notice) was used. "

Mr. Reardon noted that investor-owned utility shareholders should be subject to the risks and rewards of portfolio management decisions so that their incentives are aligned with those of ratepayers. Mr. Reardon emphasized the need to extract maximum value from existing contracts, and pointed to the California Community Choice Association’s voluntary buy-down and auction proposals as effective methods to achieve this."

Randolph, and on October 3, 2018, Ms. Sheriff met with David Gamson, advisor to Cmmr. Guzman-Aceves, and Yuliya Shmidt, advisor to Cmmr. Rechtschaffen, in two separate meetings in San Francisco, and spoke by phone with Forest Kaser, advisor to Cmmr. Picker. Ms. Sheriff stated that CLECA has bundled members, Direct Access members, and members who are now served by Community Choice Aggregators, as well as some members with onsite renewable generation to serve a portion of their load. Ms. Sheriff explained that with this membership, CLECA always tries to be as evenhanded as possible for purposes of how the different types of customers are treated. Ms. Sheriff told that CLECA strongly supports the Alternate Proposed Decision (APD), especially its treatment of legacy Utility Owned Generation costs.  Ms. Sheriff asked for the APD to be revised to explicitly reject the Joint Utilities’ proposal for a new, non-vintaged charge. Ms. Sheriff explained that substantial evidence in the proceeding weighs against adoption of the Joint Utilities’ proposal to change the power charge indifference adjustment allocator. Ms. Sheriff explained that if the Commission seeks consistency in allocation factors for bundled and departing customers, it should direct the filing of Rate Design Window applications on this narrow issue – which will give notice to other parties. With Mr. Gamson and Ms. Shmidt, Ms. Sheriff also noted CLECA’s recommendation that the APD be revised to allow for a de minimis valuation for unsold, excess resource adequacy and renewables portfolio standard resources that remain in the investor owned utilities’ portfolios, as opposed to a zero valuation.

Peterman, in San Francisco. SVCE requested that the Commission adopt the Proposed Decision (PD) rather the Alternate Proposed Decision (APD). SVCE discussed potential impacts of the APD on Community Choice Aggregation customers, and highlighted several areas of disagreement with the choices made in the APD. Mr. Balachandran made the case for including a greenhouse gas-free attribute to the market price benchmark. SVCE expressed support for the capacity benchmark described in California Community Choice Association’s (CalCCA) opening testimony, but requested that the Commission at least adopt the composite capacity benchmark proposed by CalCCA in its August 21 comments on the PD. Finally, SVCE requested that the final decision adopted by the Commission include more concrete guidance on the scope and schedule for Phase 2."

James Hendry, Regulatory and Legislative Affairs, Power Enterprise for the San Francisco Public Utilities Commission (operator of CleanPowerSF), and Neal Reardon, Director of Regulatory Affairs for SCPA, also participated on behalf of CCSF and SCPA, respectively. Mr. Hendry attended the meeting in person and Mr. Reardon attended by phone. PCE, CCSF, and SCPA representatives discussed the Proposed Decision of Administrative Law Judge Roscow (PD) and the August 14, 2018 Alternate Proposed Decision of Commissioner Peterman (APD). Ms. Pepper stated that a reasonable approach based on the record is to set the PCIA at the level contemplated by the PD or even maintain the PCIA at the current level until the second phase of the PCIA proceeding is completed. Mr. Waen discussed his experience working on PCIA issues over the course of his work with CCAs. Mr. Wiedman discussed support in the record for setting the benchmarks in a more reasonable fashion than either the APD or PD currently does and how the record supports the PD’s approach to the PCIA. Mr. Pine discussed the strong support for PCE within San Mateo County. Mr. Reardon discussed the impacts of the PCIA to SCPA’s residential customers while also noting that the rate tables PG&E provided on 8/31 contained errors which had not yet been addressed. Mr. Hendry commented that the PD/APD’s proposed value for capacity not only represents the low-range of values identified in the record of the proceeding but also represents the low range of the environmental attributes of the generation.

Suzy Hong, Deputy City Attorney, San Francisco City Attorney’s Office, the City and County of San Francisco (San Francisco) was also present. Ms. Hale described San Francisco’s Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) program, CleanPowerSF, and the potential impacts on CleanPowerSF of the Proposed Decision (PD) and the Alternate Proposed Decision (APD). Ms. Hale discussed how San Francisco believes that the PD provides a reasonable transition to the longer-term solutions proposed for Phase 2 of this proceeding. Ms. Hale explained concerns with the APD and its potential negative impacts on CleanPowerSF’s program. Ms. Hale highlighted how these impacts would hinder San Francisco’s ability to meet the City’s and the state’s environmental goals. Ms. Hale and Mr. Ramirez discussed San Francisco’s positions on the PD’s and APD’s treatment of issues regarding pre-2002 legacy utility-owned generation (UOG), the 10-year limit on cost recovery for post-2002 non-RPS UOG resources, the value for the capacity benchmark in the PCIA calculation, and a PCIA rate cap and collar. Ms. Hale and Mr. Ramirez noted San Franciso’s support of the positions of the California Community Choice Association on these issues. With respect to legacy UOG and the 10-year limit on cost recovery for post-2002 resources, Ms. Hale emphasized the need to provide incentive to investor-owned utilities (IOUs) to prudently manage their portfolios and resources. Ms. Hale questioned why IOUs should be allowed to recover from customers the uneconomic operating costs of resources owned by the IOUs."

At the second meeting, also present was Mitchell Shapson of the Legal Division. The discussion concerned the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA) and EBCE’s perspective on the Proposed Decision (PD) and Alternate Proposed Decision (APD).  EBCE representatives pointed out that the utility narrative that bundled customers are bearing a significant cost shift under the current PCIA methodology is flawed; PG&E’s 2019 ERRA filing (A.18-06-001) shows bundled customer rates substantially declining and the PCIA for departed load customers going up significantly. EBCE representatives explained that the APD differs from the PD in material ways that would have catastrophic consequences for CCAs, and where the PD balanced changes that would benefit utilities with those that benefit CCAs, the APD makes changes that solely benefit utilities. EBCE representatives noted that both the PD and the APD create a cost shift onto CCAs by making the wrong changes to the capacity benchmark price. EBCE representatives explained that the APD will hinder achievement of the state’s energy goals. Written material (attached to the notice) was used."

The AReM and DACC representatives discussed the impacts that each the Proposed Decision (PD) and Alternate Proposed Decision (APD) would have on Direct Access customers and Energy Service Providers, and stated a preference for the APD. In particular, the group discussed how the applicability of the legacy utility-owned generation costs for pre-2009 Vintage DA customers is already being addressed in A.16-04-018 et al and should be determined there; that the PD’s proposed treatment of legacy utility-owned generation costs in general might have unintended consequences; the PD’s revised market price benchmarks are not well defined, would be problematic, and that the use of the Renewable Energy Credit market index would be simpler, more accurate, more transparent and more predicable than the proposed RPS Adder. Further, the group expressed concern about the percent-based PCIA collar and discontinuation of the 10-year cost recovery rule that are proposed in the APD."

Peterman, and Mitchell Shapson of the Legal Division, and on September 5, 2018, with Yuliya Shmidt, advisor to Cmmr. Rechtschaffen Ms. Mitchell explained that San José is very concerned about providing an affordable base electricity product to its community. Ms. Solé explained that the Alternate Proposed Decision (APD) would significantly jeopardize SJCE’s ability to launch its program and invest in long term renewable resources and the community through innovative customer programs. Ms. Solé explained that the APD is bad for all customers. Ms. Solé noted that the APD is not needed since PG&E’s rates are already going down. Ms. Solé explained that the APD undermines the ability of new CCAs to launch. Additionally, and only during the meeting with Yulia Shmidt, Ms. Solé explained that if 2002 utility-owned generation (UOG) are not excluded, it is all the more important to recognize the value of GHG-free resources. Ms. Solé also explained that it is critical to reflect the long-term value of capacity since the short-term market value of capacity in California is artificially depressed due to long-term planning.

Ms. Somogyi indicated that Commercial Energy supported the concept in the Proposed Decision (PD) and Alternate Proposed Decision (APD) to commence a second phase of the case with a working group of parties to consider a longer-term change to the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA) mechanism. Ms. Somogyi recommended that the Commission provide the parties with both more specific guidance on the type of mechanism to be discussed and a limited time frame for the discussions. Commercial Energy recommends that the PD be modified to detail principles to guide the working group discussion. Commercial Energy also recommends that the Commission ensure that RECs and RA attributes from the PCIA resources can be transferred to the LSEs that will acquire the resources via allocation or auction. Ms. Somogyi stated that Commercial Energy believes the cap and annual maximum rate adjustment in the PD are too low. Ms. Somogyi stated that Commercial Energy favors the more flexible rate collar proposed in the APD. Ms. Somogyi expressed concern that the new reporting requirements for ESPs established by the PD and APD that would require ESPs to provide granular and highly sensitive contract information to the Commission.

EBCE stated that the Proposed Decision (PD) provides a reasonable interim solution to issues with the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA) while the Commission resolves remaining issues in Phase II of the PCIA. EBCE stated that it supports the PD’s legal conclusion that pre-2002 legacy utility-owned generation (UOG) costs may not be included in the PCIA for Community Choice Aggregator (CCA) customers. EBCE stated its support for the PD’s provision for a “cap/collar” to mitigate the impact of changes in the PCIA. EBCE indicated its concerns with several aspects of the PD. EBCE recommended reforms to the capacity benchmark and the greenhouse gas free price; the cap/collar mechanism recommended in the PD in Phase I would serve as a bridge to keeping parties cost-neutral until we get through Phase II.

Picker; on May 24, 2018, with Rachel Peterson and Joanna Gubman, advisors to Cmmr. Randolph; and on June 8, 2018, with Yuliya Shmidt, advisor to Cmmr. Rechtschaffen. Ms. Brandt provided EBCE’s perspective as a newer community choice aggregator (CCA). Ms. Brandt stated that the joint utilities’ GAM/PMM proposal does not adequately meet EBCE’s needs. Ms. Brandt explained that the joint utility proposal would force CCAs to buy the majority of their supply in the short-term market, since that is when supply would be made available to CCAs and the joint utility proposal does not guarantee delivery quantities. Ms. Brandt emphasized that it is important for the CPUC to provide stability to the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA) framework in the short-term as it transitions to an equitable longer-term solution.  On August 10, 2018, Ms. Brandt had a telephone conversation with John Reynolds, advisor to Cmmr. Peterman, and had two separate meetings in San Francisco with Yuliya Shmidt, advisor to Cmmr. Rechtschaffen, and David Gamson, advisor to Cmmr. Guzman Aceves. At the meeting with David Gamson also present were Evelyn Kahl, Counsel to CalCCA and Beth Vaughan, Executive Director for CalCCA. Ms. Brandt reiterated the legal and policy rationales that support the PD’s removing legacy utility-owned generation from the PCIA calculation. Ms. Brandt expressed concerns with the PD’s proposed true-up mechanism. During the meeting with David Gamson, written materials (attached to the notice) were used."

The Joint Utilities representatives discussed how the current Alternative Proposed Decision (APD) and PD – if not modified – do not ensure bundled service customer indifference, as required by California statute. The Joint Utilities discussed how the current PCIA “cost cap” is unreasonable, constitutes legal error, and is not equitable for bundled service customers, especially as set forth in the PD. The Joint Utilities stressed that the net costs of Utility-Owned Generation and mandated procurement must be shared equitably by all customers, and emphasized the need for additional clarity in the APD for the PCIA “true-up” mechanism, especially as it would apply to excess Renewable Energy Credits that the Joint Utilities were unable to sell.

At the meetings with John Reynolds and James Ralph also present was Patrick Vanbeek, Vice President of Operations of Commercial Energy. Commercial Energy indicated its support for the concept in the Proposed Decision (PD) to commence a second phase of the case; however, Commercial Energy recommended that the Commission needs to provide the parties with both more specific guidance on the type of mechanism to be discussed and a limited time frame for the discussions. Commercial Energy recommended that the Commission ensure that RECs and RA attributes from the Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA) resources can be transferred to the LSEs. Commercial Energy also addressed the PCIA cap and collar established by the PD. Commercial Energy stated that the cap and annual maximum rate adjustment are too low. During the meetings with Mr. Ralph and Mr. Gamson, Ms. Somogyi stated that Commercial Energy favors the more flexible rate collar proposed in the Alternate PD. In the meetings with Mr. Reynolds and Mr. Ralph, Ms. Somogyi and Mr. Vanbeek discussed the new reporting requirements for ESPs established by the PD that would require ESPs to provide granular and highly sensitive contract information to the Commission to inform the RPS and RA benchmarks. Commercial Energy indicated that it is not aware of a statutory or other basis on which the Commission can require ESPs to divulge sensitive contract price information, and Commercial Energy believes that available market price indices can be used in lieu of ESP contract price data.

At the meeting with Yulia Schmidt also present was Laura Martin of the Energy Division. POC representatives advocated that the $0.022/kilowatt hour per year cap on the power charge indifference adjustment (PCIA) should be a hard cap with no upward adjustment year-to-year. POC pointed-out that had the proposed decision (PD) disallowed avoidable solar and wind contract costs, in the specific case of SDG&E the (residential) PCIA would be approximately half the $0.021/kWh projected by the utility for 2018. POC noted that utility projections under current utility PCIA above-market calculation procedures indicate 2018 PCIA above market costs are at or near peak costs and these costs will decline going forward. POC expressed the opinion that utility concerns about rising above market solar and wind contract costs in future years should be addressed through securitization of existing solar and wind contracts, and not by allowing the PCIA cap to increase by as much as $0.005/kWh per year as currently proposed in the PD.

MCE and SCPA argued that the Joint Utilities’ Green Allocation Mechanism (GAM) violates statute by allocating products instead of costs to Community Choice Aggregators (CCA).  MCE and SCPA addressed the California Community Choice Association’s voluntary Staggered Portfolio Auction (SPA) as a way for all Load Serving Entities to acquire the RPS resources needed to serve their forecasted loads and meet, or voluntarily exceed RPS requirements. MCE and SCPA also noted that the GAM, unlike the SPA, would not provide CCAs the underlying energy associated with the allocated GAM Renewable Energy Credits. MCE and SCPA also indicated that they have no need for the Resource Adequacy (RA) allocations under the GAM. MCE and SCPA emphasized they are already positioned to meet their respective long-term Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requirements. MCE and SCPA indicated that forcing MCE and SCPA to be excessively long on RPS would potentially bring Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison Company well under RPS compliance.

Also present were Greg Wade, City Manager of the City of Solana Beach (City) and Executive Director of SEA; and Dan King, Assistant City Manager of the City. Mr. Wade described Solana Beach’s efforts to develop a Community Choice Aggregation program in the City. Mr. Wade stated that SEA officially launched on June 1, 2018. Mr. Wade explained that the approval of the Green Allocation Mechanism (GAM) and the Portfolio Monetization Mechanism (PMM), proposed by the Investor Owned Utilities , would cause such a detriment to SEA that the program may be forced to close, upending the expectations of the citizens of Solana Beach and frustrating the efforts of the City to address climate change. From SEA’s perspective, Mr. Tosdal explained, the existing Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA) framework, subject to modification, is the preferred option, and CalCCA’s proposals to bring down IOU portfolio costs that contribute to the PCIA – securitization and reverse auction – should be adopted. Mr. Tosdal also discussed SEA’s particular concerns about implementation."

Peterman, in San Francisco. Also present were Mitchell Shapson, Attorney, CPUC, and Nathaniel Malcolm, Policy Counsel, Marin Clean Energy (MCE). MCE and SCPA argued that the Joint Utilities’ Green Allocation Mechanism (GAM) violates statute by allocating products instead of costs to Community Choice Aggregators (CCA).  MCE and SCPA emphasized they are already positioned to meet their respective long-term Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) requirements and are projected to meet and exceed RPS requirements through 2030 without GAM allocations. MCE and SCPA also indicated that forcing MCE and SCPA to be excessively long on RPS would potentially bring Pacific Gas and Electric Company and Southern California Edison Company well under RPS compliance. In this context, MCE and SCPA addressed the California Community Choice Association’s voluntary Staggered Portfolio Auction (SPA) as a way for all Load Serving Entities to acquire the RPS resources needed to serve their forecasted loads and meet, or voluntarily exceed RPS requirements. MCE and SCPA also noted that the GAM, unlike the SPA, would not provide CCAs the underlying energy associated with the allocated GAM Renewable Energy Credits. Written materials (attached to the notice) were used."

Picker, in San Francisco. Also present were Cynthia Clark of the University of California, George Waidelich of Albertsons and Chris Hendrix of Walmart representing Direct Access Customer Coalition (DACC), Mark Fulmer of MRW & Associates, consultant to AReM and DACC, and Dan Douglass, counsel to AReM and DACC, attended telephonically. Mr. Olson and Ms. Lynch explained that the allocation of Renewable Energy Credits and Resource Adequacy through the utilities’ GAM approach does not meet what other load-serving entities want and need. Mr. Fulmer described the elements of his testimony. Mr. Waidelich explained that DA customers desire energy cost stability and predictability and that the biggest impediment is the volatility and unpredictability of Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA). Mr. Waidelich recommended that the Commission should allow DA customers to pre-pay their PCIA obligation, based on a mutually acceptable forecast of that customer’s future PCIA obligation. Mr. Hendrix discussed the AReM/DACC proposal that the Commission should institute a cap on the PCIA. Mr. Fulmer clarified that there is already a “floor” in place and that adding a cap would create a “collar” where exposure of DA and bundled customers to volatility is more symmetric. Ms. Clark noted that DA customers in the current pre-2009 vintage tranche that have paid their stranded cost obligations should be permanently exempted from any PCIA or successor tariff."

Peterman, in San Francisco. Also present were Cynthia Clark of the University of California, George Waidelich of Albertsons and Chris Hendrix of Walmart representing Direct Access Customer Coalition (DACC), Mark Fulmer of MRW & Associates, consultant to AReM and DACC, and Dan Douglass, counsel to AReM and DACC, attended telephonically. Mr. Olson and Ms. Lynch explained that the allocation of Renewable Energy Credits and Resource Adequacy through the utilities’ GAM approach does not meet what other load-serving entities want and need. Mr. Fulmer described the elements of his testimony. Mr. Waidelich explained that DA customers desire energy cost stability and predictability and that the biggest impediment is the volatility and unpredictability of Power Charge Indifference Adjustment (PCIA). Mr. Waidelich recommended that the Commission should allow DA customers to pre-pay their PCIA obligation, based on a mutually acceptable forecast of that customer’s future PCIA obligation. Mr. Hendrix discussed the AReM/DACC proposal that the Commission should institute a cap on the PCIA. Mr. Fulmer clarified that there is already a “floor” in place and that adding a cap would create a “collar” where exposure of DA and bundled customers to volatility is more symmetric. Ms. Clark noted that DA customers in the current pre-2009 vintage tranche that have paid their stranded cost obligations should be permanently exempted from any PCIA or successor tariff. "

Kahl urged consideration of a six-week extension in the procedural schedule. Vaughan emphasized the critical importance of an extension under the circumstances to enable a fully informed discussion of issues.. Kahl noted that while CalCCA prefers to narrow issues through settlement, even with this extension there may not be sufficient time for meaningful settlement discussions. CalCCA representatives stated it does not oppose further extending the schedule beginning with the Proposed Decision mail date."
