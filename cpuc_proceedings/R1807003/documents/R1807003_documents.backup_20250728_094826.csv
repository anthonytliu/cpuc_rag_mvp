Rechtschaffen, in San Francisco. Mr. Kelly reiterated the points made in IEP's comments on the 2018 Renewables Portfolio Standard (RPS) procurement plans, filed on September 21,2018. Mr. Kelly observed that the revised RPS procurement plans filed by load-serving entities in response to the enactment of Senate Bill 100 did not reveal a significant change in procurement and would not result in the procurement of new renewable energy resources needed by 2030. Mr. Kelly explained that to avoid a boom-or-bust cycle for procurement of renewable energy from new resources, the Commission should exercise the authority the Legislature granted it in Public Utilities Code Section 399.15(bX3) and increase the RPS requirement for LSEs above the statutory minimum. Mr. Cragg observed that an increased RPS level would also mesh with the state's efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emission levels by 2030. Mr. Kelly and Mr. Cragg also discussed the issues raised by proposals for a procurement entity. Written materials (attached to the notice) were used. "

Peterman. ACC members discussed integration between the Integrated Resource Planning and Renewable Portfolio Standard proceedings and recommended that the interaction between the procurement and transmission planning process needs to be a coordinated effort between the Commission and the California Independent System Operator with clear direction from both moving forward. ACC Members stressed the importance of timing in the current procurement cycle. ACC members also discussed the fleeting opportunity to obtain low-cost sources of renewable energy with the federal production tax credit (PTC) set to expire. ACC Members discussed the levelized cost of wind, both with and without the PTC, and how individual Load-Serving Entities reflect the value of PTC-eligible wind."
