Picker, in San Francisco. Also present were Daniel Buch, Supervisor, Helena Oh, Regulatory Analyst, and Rosanne O’Hara, Staff Counsel, for the ORA. ORA representatives discussed ORA’s response to Stem Inc.’s Petition for Modification of Decision 16-09-056. ORA recommended that the Commission continue to use the Self Generation Incentive Program’s (SGIP) Round Trip Efficiency (RTE) standard for energy storage until the Commission can develop a greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions metric that is appropriate for storage supporting demand response. ORA recommended that the new metric be independent of the SGIP proceeding, unless the SGIP Signal Working Group can develop an appropriate metric that is available to non-SGIP resources and that can outlast the program’s sunset date. ORA explained that the restrictions placed on storage are intended to fulfill the purpose of demand response to reduce GHG emissions. ORA described the deficiencies of the SGIP RTE as a stand-alone requirement and the potential for an interim solution to ensure that the Commission’s demand response programs reduce GHG emissions while also addressing reliability and cost concerns of previously approved demand response contracts."

During the meeting of April 11, 2018, ORA detailed the challenges that energy storage presents when used as a demand response resource that operates in inopportune times from an emissions standpoint. ORA reiterated its recommendations to require, with certain narrowly defined exceptions, energy storage to meet the SGIP RTE requirement until a more appropriate emissions metric is developed and the possibility of an interim solution. ORA also discussed the potential application and implementation of the RTE for non-SGIP energy storage resources participating in demand response."

Also present were Laura Gray, Energy Storage Policy Advisor for the California Solar & Storage Association, Jin Noh, Policy Manger for the California Energy Storage Alliance, and via telephone, Tony Brunello, Principal, California Strategies and Advocacy, representing Engie Storage. Mr. Baak discussed Stem’s pending Petition for Modification of Decision 16-09-056 (Petition). Mr. Baak explained that the Decision could potentially prevent energy storage systems, as a resource category, from providing valuable grid services, including demand response, and could do serious harm to the energy storage industry as an unintended consequence of this Decision. Mr. Baak and Ms. Gray explained this was due to a requirement for energy storage systems to meet a flawed greenhouse gas (GHG) metric for the Self-Generation Incentive Program (SGIP). Mr. Baak described the purpose of the Petition. Mr. Baak and Mr. Noh described the initial discussions that led to the earlier decision, and explained that it was not well understood that the SGIP GHG requirement was flawed. Mr. Baak and Ms. Gray discussed the potential negative impact on non-SGIP funded Local Capacity Requirements projects."

Guzman Aceves, in San Francisco.  Also present were Shelly Lyser, Regulatory Analyst, Helena Oh, Regulatory Analyst, and Rosanne O’Hara, Staff Counsel, for the ORA.  ORA representatives discussed Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s Advice Letter 4991-E-B, Southern California Edison Company’s Advice Letter 3542-E-A, and San Diego Gas & Electric Company’s Advice Letter 3031-E-A, filed on June 15, 2017, and methods for enforcing the prohibition on the use of certain fossil fueled back up generation (BUG) for demand response. Campbell pointed out that the Commission has a long-standing policy of prohibiting use of BUGs to provide demand response, and that one of the Commission’s goals for demand response is to reduce pollution. Lyser described how the proposed enforcement mechanisms for Type 2 resources are insufficient.  Lyser also reiterated ORA’s recommendation to require hourly generation meters for all Type 2 resources and ORA’s support for the proposal for an auditor to randomly sample a portion of those resources. Lyser noted that the benefits of participating in a demand response program are greater on average, per year, than the total cost of installing an appropriate meter. Campbell noted that requiring meter installations for Type 2 resources would also provide a transparent method to examine the usage of prohibited fossil fueled BUGs and would help advance the Commission’s activities to further the State’s environmental goals."

Also present were Bruce Kaneshiro of the Energy Division; and Brooke Reilly, Director, and Corey Mayers, Principal Policy Analyst, Demand Response, and Melody Agustin, Manager, Demand Response Operations, for PG&E.  Reilly stated that the 2017 proposed decision (PD) should state that the extra six million dollars should be used for the 2017 DRAM. Mayers stated that the twelve million dollars for the 2018 DRAM has not been authorized and that the PD should be changed to include a mechanism to provide for its cost recovery. Agustin stated that the PD should be changed so that it does not require dis-enrolling customers who may not be included in a PDR immediately. Mayers stated that PG&E should send letters to customers whose data has been released under the new ‘click-through’ protocol to help reduce PG&E’s liability against fraud. Mayers further stated that a consensus around this process would be very difficult to find, and that the language in the PD should be changed to allow for something short of a consensus.  Reilly stated that PG&E hasn’t determined a final solution for accepting customer data release authorizations. "

SUMMARY:  On April 20, 2016, Mona Tierney-Lloyd, Senior Director, Western Regulatory Affairs, EnerNOC, Inc. (EnerNOC), met with Matthew Tisdale, advisor to Cmmr. Florio, in San Francisco. Also present was Kenneth Schisler, Vice President of Regulatory and Government Affairs for EnerNOC. Tierney-Lloyd urged the Commission to reach a resolution on the 2017 Demand Response (DR) Program Plans and begin a process to evaluate 2018 options as soon as possible. Tierney-Lloyd indicated that DR Providers, such as EnerNOC, have no visibility as to the options it will have for providing services to its customers in 2017 with the exception of its bid for DRAM services and the Investor Owned Utilities’ (IOUs) 2017 DR Program proposals. Tierney-Lloyd indicated that if the IOUs’ proposals were adopted by the Commission, EnerNOC would have to do some significant work to modify its customer relationships for 2017. As an example, Tierney-Lloyd stated that Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) had proposed to eliminate the Aggregator Managed Portfolio (AMP) contracts. Tierney-Lloyd noted that there is also no visibility into what options may be available for 2018, including for Demand Response Auction Mechanism."

Florio, in San Francisco.  Also present were Bruce Kaneshiro and Rachel McMahon of the Energy Division, and Delphine Hou, External Affairs Manager, and Jill Powers, Smart Grid Solutions Manager, for the CAISO. The CAISO noted that Phase 2 of the CAISO’s Energy Storage and Distributed Energy Resources (ESDER) stakeholder initiative will allow a stakeholder led working group to propose new baseline and/or performance methods for the CAISO.  The CAISO noted that it has been actively working with stakeholders to implement its Demand Response Registration System (DRRS). The CAISO further noted that there is a plan to migrate existing demand response service accounts to the DRRS. The CAISO clarified demand response integration issues raised by Southern California Edison Company in its 2017 demand response bridge funding application. The CAISO reiterated its concerns with the evolving structure of the demand response market in which utility-administered demand response programs and budgets are funded via Commission authorization and third-party programs are subject to competitive solicitation. The CAISO noted that these dual mechanisms are not complementary and that the Commission should choose a clear path and to avoid creating a hybrid market in which competitively procured resources compete against utility-administered programs for a limited pool of demand response customers."

Mayers further stated that the non-IOU DRPs might not be registered at the CAISO.  Reilly stated that PG&E plans to use the process that SCE does to address this. Reilly further stated that PG&E would immediately begin using the CAISO reporting template. Mayers indicated that PG&E is planning to file a request to use unspent 2015-2016 fund shifting dollars on Rule 24 enhancements.

(EnerNOC), met with Matthew Tisdale, advisor to Cmmr. Florio, in San Francisco.  Also present were Sara Steck Myers, attorney for Comverge, Inc., CPower, EnerNOC, EnergyHub, and Johnson Controls, Inc., (JCI)) (collectively,  Joint DR Parties). Jennifer Anne Chamberlin, Director of Regulatory Affairs - Integrated Demand Resources for JCI, and David P. Lowrey, Director, Regulatory Strategy, for Comverge, participated by telephone.  Tierney-Lloyd indicated that the Joint DR Parties had filed comments identifying multiple legal and factual errors in the Proposed Decision (PD) and Alternate Proposed Decision (APD). Tierney-Lloyd advised that the Joint DR Parties' allegations of error in both the PD and APD remained.  Myers took exception to the addition to the revised APD of Commission ""efforts"" claimed by the APD as offsetting or ""account[ing] for any interim loss of megawatts as a result of this decision."" Myers also renewed objections to the ""presentation"" made by Cmmr. Florio at the November 5 Business Meeting and the need for an All Party Meeting with Commissioners. Chamberlin and Tierney Lloyd emphasized the Joint DR Parties support wholesale market integration, but that significant barriers still exist and need to be addressed. Lowrey noted that efforts to integrate DR resources into the wholesale market, while laudable, included certain exemptions to the California Independent System Operator's rules. Written material (attached to the notice) was used."

Chamberlin stated that, given their significant errors, neither the Proposed Decision (PD) nor Alternate Proposed Decision (APD) should be issued as written. Chamberlin urged that a further Alternate PD should be issued to, among other things, adopt the Alternative Proposal for hard-trigger mechanisms included in the Valuation Working Group report; remove the unsupported ""conclusion"" that event-based LM DR has no capacity value; retain the 2018 bifurcation transition date adopted by the Commission; and make significant corrections to the proposed C-E protocols.  Chamberlin stated that absent an Alternate PD, the PD, with significant modifications, should be issued over the APD. Tierney-Lloyd explained that the failure of the PD and the APD to adopt a hard-trigger proposal was not proof that event-based load modifying resources had no avoided capacity value.

Florio, in San Francisco. Also present were Yuliya Shmidt, Program and Project Supervisor, Sudheer Gokhale, Senior Utilities Engineer, and ORA Analysts Zita Kline, Roseanne O'Hara, and Xian Ming (Cindy) Li. Gokhale discussed the six NRG Distributed Generation PR LLC (NRG) contracts that rely on Back-up generation (BUGs) for demand response and presented a comparison of performance standards across different programs.  Shmidt explained that if the contracts are not accepted as preferred resources, these contracts are for a 2022 obligation so there is plenty of time for SCE to fulfill its Long-Term Procurement Plan (LTPP).  Shmidt raised NRG's argument that these contracts can be classified as distributed generation (DG). Shmidt explained these contracts are structured as DR and would be bid into wholesale markets as such; thus, if NRG wants to use that argument they would need to restructure the contracts. Gokhale discussed concerns that the utilities could bid supply-side DR at such high prices that the resources are never called. Regarding benefits ORA sees with ex-post cost effectiveness tests, Peck explained the megawatts (MW) approved in applications are typically reduced over the years as performance is lower than anticipated. Gokhale explained that utilities would not call to the current limits of hourly availability due to concerns for customer fatigue and availability hours should be lower than currently assumed. Peck also discussed the need for stakeholders to provide input before the Commission issues program guidance documents to help shape the utilities' DR program proposals.  A written material (attached to the notice) was used."

Florio; and Heather Sanders, Director of Regulatory Affairs - Distributed Energy Resources, Ali Miremadi, Operations Policy Manager, and John Goodin, Regulatory Policy Manager, for the CAISO. The CAISO representatives explained its planned efforts to reduce the cost of integrating demand response (DR) into the CAISO market. The CAISO stated that it is committed to reviewing telemetry requirements applicable to demand response resources. The CAISO also indicated that it will work with stakeholders to establish different customer baseline methodologies for DR resources. The CAISO expressed its support for a Commission process to resolve issues related to the demand response provider-load-serving entity agreement.  The CAISO noted the importance of resolving the 10-day registration gap for DR resources enrolling in the CAISO's DR registration system. Written material (attached to the notice) was used."

Florio, in San Francisco. Also present was Eric Borden, staff analyst with TURN, and Kevin Woodruff, consultant for TURN, participated by telephone. TURN representatives expressed the following opinions concerning issues in this proceeding: 1. The Commission should promote competitive market procurement to rationalize costs for demand response products, keeping in mind that customers providing similar services may have different opportunity costs for reducing electricity use. 2. TURN supports increasing the use of short-response time HVAC load for both reliability and renewable integration.  3.&#61472;Procurement planning policies must ensure that demand response actually reduces the construction of new fossil generation.  4. It is not clear how much demand response will be available during periods of solar overgeneration to assist with spring time ramping needs, since much of the demand response potential is temperature-sensitive. 5. While TURN supports integrating demand response with wholesale markets, we caution that not all products and services will necessarily fit into the ""market mechanism"" operated by the CAISO.  6. The DRAM should procure both PDR and RDRR resources. 7. The notion of demand response as a ""preferred resource"" obscures the fact that environmental benefits of load shifting are limited."

Florio, in San Francisco.  Also present was Nora Sheriff, counsel to CLECA. Dr. Barkovich explained that ""historical artifact"" is why the Base Interruptible Program (BIP) incentive level is addressed in Southern California Edison Company (SCE) General Rate Case (GRC) Phase 2 proceedings; she further noted that the method used there for setting the incentive level is the same as it would be in a Demand Response (DR) docket. Dr. Barkovich noted that other DR program incentives are also set in SCE GRC Phase 2. Dr. Barkovich highlighted the need for stability in incentive levels, and warned against changing them too frequently. Sheriff noted that testimony had been filed addressing the BIP incentive level in the ongoing SCE GRC Phase 2; she suggested that the issue remain there for the 2015-2017 rate case cycle. Dr. Barkovich provided a status update on the integration of BIP as a Reliability Demand Response Resource (RDRR) in the California Independent System Operator's (CAISO) markets.  Sheriff noted that costs of direct participation should be considered as well as benefits of direct participation. Barkovich addressed the Potential Study process. Sheriff raised the issue of Back-Up Generation (BUG). Sheriff also noted that Decision 11-10-003 required consistency with federal, state and local air quality agencies' definitions of fossil-fueled BUG. Sheriff recommended workshops with those agencies.  Dr. Barkovich reviewed the status of the Supply Integration Working Group efforts at reaching reasonable solutions with the CAISO. Dr. Barkovich expressed concern that as reliability requirements become more stringent. Dr. Barkovich also discussed the possibility of reliance on K-Y-Z pulse data or statistical sampling to help mitigate telemetry costs.  Sheriff mentioned the ""distribution marketplace"" being contemplated in the Integrated Demand Side Management proceeding (Rulemaking 14-10-003), and she posited that perhaps Load Modifying event-based DR could monetize value there eventually. She expressed concern regarding timing; however, as a distribution marketplace will likely not be established by 2018.  Written material (attached to the notice) was used. "

Florio, in San Francisco. Tierney-Lloyd discussed the significant amount of work that was being undertaken by the working groups identified in Decision (D.)14-12-024, as modified by D.15-12-007, in order to achieve that decision's deadlines. Despite the sincere efforts of all of the parties, Tierney-Lloyd observed that there were some remaining thorny issues, the resolution of which are very integral to whether and to what extent DR resources participate in the wholesale market. Tierney-Lloyd expressed her desire to moderate expectations as to the results of the first Demand Response (DR) Auction Mechanism auction, other than testing the validity of the mechanism. In addition, Tierney-Lloyd expressed concern that Aggregator Managed Program contracts appear to be singled out for transitioning to becoming supply-side resources and that there appears to be a desire to eliminate or minimize the value for load modifying resources.  Tierney-Lloyd indicated that the Commission should have some patience while these new mechanisms are being developed. Tierney-Lloyd indicated that EnerNOC did not support California Independent System Operator's definition of how DR resources would ""re-shape"" the demand curve. Ms. Tierney-Lloyd concluded that low energy prices in most hours will correlate strongly with low dispatch of DR in most hours."
