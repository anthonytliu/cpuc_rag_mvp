SDG&E discussed the structure of the SOMAH program and the challenges that SDG&E faces in implementing the program given its limited administration budget, which is not sufficient to fund needed upgrades to SDG&E’s billing system. SDG&E representatives stated that SDG&E filed an Advice Letter to complete the necessary IT work that will accommodate the complicated billing necessary for this program. SDG&E explained that the high cost of the IT work is because SDG&E’s billing system is more than 20 years old and implementing initiatives like SOMAH requires extensive work. SDG&E is replacing its billing system in 2021, which will allow programs like SOMAH to be launched faster and for significantly less money."

With respect to the latter, the solar parties discussed whether the study should exclude a cost benefit analysis of the current tariff so that parties can provide their own cost benefit assessments. In addition, the solar parties addressed the use of an updated version of the DER avoided cost model as the vehicle for assessing costs and benefits in the upcoming proceeding. "

Guzman Aceves, in San Francisco. Also present was Jeremy Waen, Senior Regulatory Analyst for PCE; and Jan Pepper, Chief Executive Officer, and Jeremy Waen, Senior Regulatory Analyst, for PCE, Nathaniel Malcolm, counsel for MCE, and David Peffer, regulatory counsel for the Lancaster, participated in the meeting via teleconference. The CCA Parties’ representatives discussed matters related to Commissioner Guzman Aceves’ Alternate Revised Proposed Decision (Revised APD). The CCA Parties representatives stated their support for the programs established by Revised APD, but registered their concern that the Revised APD’s discussion of the Community Solar Green Tariff program does not sufficiently address the role and eligibility of Community Choice Aggregation (CCA) programs. The CCA Parties stated that CCA programs should qualify for funding by administering their own Community Solar Green Tariff programs. The CCA Parties pointed to Demand Response as a helpful analog for how CCA programs could participate in Community Solar Green Tariff programs. The CCA Parties asked that the Revised APD be clarified to invite CCA programs to bring forth Community Solar Green Tariff proposals on an equal footing with the investor-owned utilities (IOUs). The CCA Parties suggested that a workshop might be helpful to develop the expected framework for content in the advice letters. Regarding the Disadvantaged Communities Green Tariff program, the CCA Parties noted that in order to implement a program that is equivalent to the IOUs’ programs CCA customers must be able to offer a discount of 20% off a participating customer’s total bill, which includes both the CCA-produced generation charge and the IOU-produced delivery charge."

Ms. Lazerow expressed the parties’ support for the Alternate Proposed Decision (APD). Ms. Lazerow explained that community solar is the most similar to standard Net Energy Metering (NEM). Ms. Raval then explained that, while the parties also support Green Tariff and SASH alternatives, the Green Tariff as designed in the APD is not adequate to meet requirements as an alternative to NEM. Mr. DeVar then explained that Community Solar is legal – the legality argument, raised for the first time in a reply comment, is not well-founded in law. Ms. Lazerow explained that communities are already asking for, and contemplating, Community Solar projects that would qualify under the APD."

PCE discussed its support for the Alternate Decision and the changes it believes are necessary to support Community Choice Aggregators (CCAs) adopting disadvantaged communities (DAC)-Green Tariffs and/or community solar programs. With respect to the DAC-Green Tariff program, Mr. Wiedman pointed out that CCAs cannot access the funds identified in the Alternate Decision to support such programs. With respect to the Community Solar program, Mr. Wiedman recommended that CCAs be permitted to develop community solar programs aimed at serving their DACs regardless of whether those communities fall into the top 5% of communities per CalEnviroScreen. Mr. Wiedman stated PCE’s support for allowing a community solar facility located in one DAC to be permitted to serve customers within any DAC in a county, and the need for flexibility in timing for identifying benefiting accounts. Mr. Wiedman expressed PCE’s support for workforce development and training requirements. Mr. Gupta noted PCE’s desire to provide opportunities for residents of DACs to access renewable energy resources located in their communities."

ORA noted that the Disadvantaged Communities-Green Tariff (DAC-Green Tariff) program would be less expensive compared to the Community Solar program proposed in the APD and more efficient since the benefits of the program are narrowly tailored to low-income customers.

Mr. Kenney stated that the Proposed Decision (PD) is correct to focus on the low-income customer segment. Mr. Kenney further stated that the PG&E’s Disadvantaged Community (DAC) Green Tariff serves the goals of AB327 most efficiently, while the APD’s VNEM proposal is less cost-effective, and lacks customer protection. Mr. Hennigan stated that the 1.3% difference in solar NEM uptake between DACs and non-DACs can be explained by the higher proportion of low-income customers in DACs. Mr. Hennigan described PG&E’s DAC Green Tariff program and the expanded VNEM, which would allow customers to use IOU’s T&D for free. Mr. Dietz stated that PG&E’s program will also install solar in DAC communities, but without subsidies to customers who do not need it. Mr. Dietz further stated that the expansions of VNEM contemplated in the APD would simply increase the size of the program without improving its efficiency at delivering benefits to low-income customers. Written material (attached to the notice) was used in all three communications."

At the meeting with Yuliya Shmidt also present were Robert Kenney, Vice President, Regulatory Affairs, and Patrick Hennigan, Senior Strategic Analyst, Strategy and Policy Design, for PG&E. Mr. Kenney stated that the Proposed Decision is correct to focus on the low-income customer segment. Mr. Kenney further stated that the PG&E’s DAC Green Tariff serves the goals of AB327 most efficiently, while the Alternative Proposed Decision’s VNEM proposal is less cost-effective, and lacks customer protection. Mr. Hennigan stated that the 1.3% difference in solar NEM uptake between DACs and non-DACs can be explained by the higher proportion of low-income customers in DACs. Mr. Hennigan described PG&E’s DAC Green Tariff program and the expanded VNEM. Mr. Dietz stated that PG&E’s program will also install solar in DAC communities, but without subsidies to customers who do not need it. Mr. Dietz further stated that the expansions of VNEM contemplated in the APD would simply increase the size of the program without improving its efficiency at delivering benefits to low-income customers. Written material (attached to the notice) was used."

GRID personnel shared their objectives for alternatives to the net energy metering (NEM) successor tariff for disadvantaged communities (DACs) being considered in this proceeding, including developing a suite of programs serving various housing arrangements, and implementing programs that will be scalable, have a high likelihood of success, and build upon ratepayer investments to the extent possible. GRID personnel explored various funding mechanisms for a Single-family Affordable Solar Homes (SASH) program augmentation. Stan Greschner urged the Commission to consider a timeline of extension/augmentation through 2030. Cathleen Monahan recommended that the Commission consider a broad definition of DACs, one that includes environmentally and economically disadvantaged communities, and is grounded in existing definitions used in Commission-led programming for the Investor-Owned Utility territories. GRID personnel described the need for ironclad consumer protection measures for low-income participants in all Commission-developed programs. GRID discussed consumer protection measures, qualifying requirements, and job training examples from the SASH program."

Guzman Aceves, in San Francisco. Mr. Wiedman discussed PCE's interest in serving customers in disadvantaged communities via innovative program offerings that utilize virtual net metering (VNM) instead of a subsidized Green Tariff Shared Renewables (GTSR)-like program. Mr. Wiedman highlighted that the cross subsidy arguments raised by parties are not based on any Commission approved methodology and that piloting a GTSR-like program and a VNM program are not mutually exclusive options. Moreover, Mr. Wiedman discussed how community choice aggregator management of a VNM-based program could address many of the other criticisms of VNM raised by proponents of subsidized GTSR-like offerings."

Mr. Dietz stated that the strength of PG&E’s proposal, Solar CARE Plus, is that it is targeted to low-income customers, and is designed to be easy for participants compared to more project-based proposals. Mr. Hennigan described PG&E’s proposal, and noted that it is aimed entirely at low income and more of its costs go to benefits for low-income customers, unlike DAC VNEM, which would, as a net effect, put more costs onto CARE customers than it would relieve. Mr. Hennigan further stated that the Solar Care Plus projects can be directed to particular communities that have high participation and so will include the benefits within the community. Mr. Dietz stated that this low-income approach is a better approach, since it alleviates inequity more for every dollar money spent on the program, and can be scaled by the commission to appropriate levels."

Hennigan stated that the difference in DAC and non-DAC residential solar uptake rates can be explained by different CARE and non-CARE uptake rates.  Hennigan described PG&E’s proposal, and noted that it is aimed entirely at low income, and more of its costs go to benefits for low-income customers, unlike DAC VNEM, which would, as a net effect, put more costs onto CARE customers than it would relieve.  Dietz explained that this low-income approach is a better approach. Written material (attached to the notice) was used."

Scott Murtishaw, advisor to President Picker, was an attendee to the conference and has access to the presentations.  Fang presented the following presentation by Ken Schiermeyer & Will Matsuoka, Forecasting Long-Term Hourly Loads, and a presentation, Solar Adoption & Customer Consumption in the Residential Sector.  Fang stated that Solar Adoption and Customer Consumption presentations showed that upon further examination of the impacts to customers’ load before and after solar continues to indicate that solar adoption is unlikely to result in a reduction in the costs to serve residential solar customers.  Fang noted that while net consumption decreased one year after solar installation, over 43% increased consumption one year after installation, and on average, customers with decreased consumption in Year 1 increased consumption in Year 2, resulting in overall consumption of solar customers increasing two years after installation.  Fang explained that energy usage is not the key indicator to cost of service.  Fang noted that residential customers with solar continue to have peak levels that are over 70% higher than those without solar.  Fang indicated that average size of solar installed has increased by 51% over a 10-year period, while net consumption has increased from '250 kWh per month in 2015 to '280 kWh per month in 2016.

Also present were Kyra Bush Sarem, Co-Founder and General Counsel of Everyday Energy; Dawn Anaiscourt, Director, CPUC Regulatory Affairs, Southern California Edison Company; Sidney Dietz, Director, Regulatory Relations, and Patrick Hennigan, Senior Strategic Analyst, for Pacific Gas and Electric; Sylvia Martinez, Senior Project Manager, Community Housing Works; G Andrew Blauvelt, Coordinator, the MASH Coalition; Brad Heaver, Policy Director, California Solar Energy Industries Association (CALSEIA), and Tony Brunello from California Strategies.  The purpose of the meeting was to demonstrate that the meeting participants, who collectively have the most extensive experience in delivering solar PV to multifamily affordable housing in the state of California and have been the main participants in the Multifamily Affordable Solar Housing Program (MASH), hereinafter referred to as “the Experienced Parties” – expressed their collective agreement that the legislative intent of AB 693 is to utilize the current MASH Program infrastructure to implement AB 693, and that there is a statutory mandate for the Multifamily Affordable Housing Solar Roofs Program (MASHR) be implemented by June 30, 2017.  The Experienced Parties also discussed their concern that creating a complicated administration regime for the MAHSR Program will drive up the soft costs of providing solar and result in higher solar prices.  The Experienced Parties agree that the Commission should not fund batteries with MAHSR Program funds.  Representatives of Everyday Energy, the MASH Coalition, and CALSEIA suggested that there should be an exemption from mandatory Time of Use rates for residents of multifamily affordable housing served through virtual net metering.

Dietz stated that some customers, with both large and small projects, have an expectation that there will be a reservation system, but that others do not have that expectation.

Also present were Sara Kamins of the Energy Division; Stephen Rogers, Commercial Solar Consultant of the Solar Company; and Dan Halperin, Director, Distributed Generation, David Gabbard, Director, Electric Generation Interconnection, and Sidney Dietz, Director, Regulatory Relations, for Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E). Halperin described that the queue of projects that would be eligible for NEM 1, under the joint CALSEIA/SEIA/PG&E proposal for new eligibility criteria, will soon be large enough to fill up the NEM 1 cap. Halperin presented a revised version of the NEM Program Limit Report.  Dietz stated that if the cap were filled in this way, it would disadvantage a group of customers who had planned on the current eligibility rules being in place until the cap was hit. Gabbard described that because the change in eligibility would be happening late, there would be a potential gap between when NEM 1 is filled and when NEM 2 is available.  CALSEIA and PG&E representatives discussed potential for an interim tariff that could also be delayed if it is protested. Gabbard further stated that even if the decision were issued quickly, the changes in tariffs and system changes would make the proposal queue even longer if developers of solar systems for residential customers submit Customer Authorizations for projects that have been contracted but not built. Heavner described that PG&E reports its queue differently than Southern California Edison, and that PG&E has recently disclosed that there are more than 300 MW of projects under development that were not previously reported. Gabbard explained that PG&E’s NEM Program Limit Report was consistent with guidelines provided by the CPUC.   Heavner further stated that many large commercial customers have signed solar contracts with expectations of interconnecting under NEM 1, with protection from unanticipated delays through use of a reservation system. Rogers explained that delays in the interconnection study process often lead to delays in project completion. Heavner and Gabbard described a wide range of possible remedies, and stated that none would satisfy the expectations of all types of customers.  Written materials (attached to the notice) were used."

Greenlining noted that it is appropriate to use a CalEnviroScreen-exclusive definition of disadvantaged communities (pursuant to Senate Bill 535) for programs or incentives that are closely tied to climate investments, but there are sound policy justifications supporting a broader definition for programs or incentives not directly related to climate investments."

Foundation’s representatives expressed support for the Proposed Decision (PD) in general and highlighted the areas of concern about the PD. Specifically, Foundation explained how the PD’s imposition of a new method for calculating nonbypassable charges (NBCs) would disproportionately impose charges on large commercial and industrial (LC&I) NEM customers and the impact those charges would have on the ability for the sector to sustainably grow. Foundation also discussed how LC&I customers currently pay demand charges and energy on TOU rates and that parties generally agree that LC&I customers do not contribute to any unwarranted cost shift to non-NEM customers. Foundation urged that the risk of stalling growth in the on-site wind sector combined with the absence of a cost shift problem involving LC&I NEM customers warranted exempting these customers from any changes in the methodology for calculating NBCs. Foundation offered to provide proposed modifications to the PD, which Sherr sent to Nick Chaset.  A copy of the written communication is attached to the notice."

Brad Heavner, Policy Director for the California Solar Energy Industries Association (CALSEIA) participated in the meeting with Rachel Peterson.  Jeanine Cotter, CEO of Luminalt, Inc., participated in the meeting with Ehern Seybert. During these meetings, parties’ (collectively, Joint Solar Parties or JSP) representatives discussed concerns with the investor-owned utilities’ untimely proposal for a net feed-in tariff (net FiT). JSP explained that in addition to consideration of the utilities’ untimely proposal for a net FiT being barred by Commission rules of practice, a FiT would devastate sustained growth in customer-sited distributed generation because FiTs may not be financeable, result in income tax consequences for customers, and jeopardize eligibility for the federal investment tax credit. JSP noted that FiTs have been unsuccessful in supporting sustained growth of customer-sited distributed generation (DG). JSP expressed support for the Proposed Decision’s (PD) determination that time-of-use rates should be a central part of the successor tariff. JSP discussed the importance of the PD’s determination to provide 20 year grandfathering of the successor tariff.  Written materials (attached to the notice) were used. "

Solarrepresentatives expressed that effectively starting mandatory time of use rates at the beginning of the successor tariff could create customer backlash and impact customer adoption, that mandating time of use rates for net metered customers who installed solar under tiered rates would be confusing and unfair to customers, that non-bypassable charges assessed on exported power should be more limited than indicated in the PD, and that greater emphasis should be placed on the total resource cost test and societal cost test.

Halperin expressed PG&E's disappointment and opposition to the Net Energy Metering (NEM) proposed decision which does not meaningfully reduce the cost-shift in the current NEM program. Halperin stated that the proposed decision will lock in $2.5-$5.0 billion of annual cost-shifting by 2020. Johnson, Halperin and Jacobson said that the decision by Congress to extend the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) eliminates market uncertainty and will further ensure robust growth of rooftop solar. PG&E representatives said the Commission should reconsider the proposed decision in light of the ITC extension.  PG&E representatives urged the Commission to adopt a successor tariff that significantly reduces the size of this cost-shift and also results in vigorous growth of rooftop solar.

Johnson stated that PG&E supports the solar-rooftop industry's efforts to provide certainty about whether a customer will be on the original or successor Net Energy Metering (NEM) tariff and about the treatment of customers during a possible 'gap' identified between PG&E hitting the NEM cap and the possibly-delayed NEM successor decision. Johnson further stated that the a reservation system could solve the uncertainty problem, but that it would cause the automated interconnection process, which takes from one to three days, to be replaced by a manual interconnection process, which would likely take thirty to forty five days.   Johnson stated that PG&E could support an interim 'gap' tariff that would mitigate uncertainty for customers who sign up after the cap. Dietz stated that either solution would require a revised NEM tariff and, if protested, could take as long or longer than the NEM successor decision and its tariff revision."

The SEIA and TASC representatives recommended that Energy Division and E3 modify these elements of the Tool, as they are difficult for users to know how to change."
