QUESTION:
{question}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1.  **Structure Your Response:** Organize your answer with clear sections using HTML formatting:
   - **Executive Summary:** Start with a brief 1-2 sentence overview
   - **Key Findings:** Present the main regulatory information with bullet points
   - **Detailed Analysis:** Provide comprehensive analysis with numbered points
   - **Regulatory Impact:** Explain implications and requirements
   - **Important Dates/Deadlines:** Highlight time-sensitive information if applicable

2.  **Use HTML Formatting:** Format your response with proper HTML tags:
   - Use `<h4>` tags for section headings
   - Use `<ul>` and `<li>` for bullet points
   - Use `<ol>` and `<li>` for numbered lists
   - Use `<strong>` for emphasis on key terms
   - Use `<em>` for regulatory requirements
   - Use `<br>` for line breaks where needed

3.  **Prioritize Numerical Data:** Pay extremely close attention to any numerical data, dollar amounts ($), percentages (%), or values in tables. Present these in formatted lists or tables when applicable.

4.  **Perform Inference:** Based on the text, make logical inferences. Clearly state when you are making an inference using <em>Based on [Source A] and [Source B], it can be inferred that...</em>

5.  **Cite Sources Rigorously:** For every piece of information, you MUST cite the source using this exact format: `[CITE:filename.pdf,page_12]` where filename.pdf is the document name and page_12 is the page number.

6.  **Answer Fully:** If the context does not contain the answer, state in a formatted box: "<div style='background-color: #fff3cd; border: 1px solid #ffeaa7; border-radius: 4px; padding: 10px; margin: 10px 0;'><strong>Note:</strong> The provided context does not contain sufficient information to answer this question.</div>"
