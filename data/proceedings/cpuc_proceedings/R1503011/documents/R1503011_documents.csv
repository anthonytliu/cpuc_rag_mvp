Florio, in San Francisco.  Greg Bass, Director, Noble Americas Energy Solutions LLC, and Cynthia Clark, Associate Wholesale Electricity Program Manager, University of California, Office of the President, attended the meeting by telephone. Mara, Bass and Clark explained that AReM and DACC strongly objected to the December 15, 2015 proposed decision's (PD) determination that the investor-owned utilities (IOUs) would be permitted to count all of the energy storage projects funded partially through the Self-Generation Incentive Program. Mara, Bass and Clark also discussed the PD's determination that the load-serving entity of the customers installing energy storage projects should retain the storage credits.  Mara, Bass and Clark stated AReM and DACC have proposed that the customer that invested in the energy storage project be able to assign the energy storage procurement ""credit"" to the LSE as they choose.  Mara discussed the PD's determinations regarding the Power Charge Indifference Amount (PCIA). Mara explained that all PCIA policy issues should be addressed uniformly in Track 2 in this rulemaking.  Mara explained that the PD erred in stating that the Commission would determine the PCIA cost recovery period for the IOUs' 2014 energy storage solicitations in the separate proceedings.  Mara requested that the PD be revised."

Mara and Bass explained that AReM and direct access customers (DAC) strongly objected to the Proposed Decision's (PD) determination that the investor-owned utilities (IOUs) would be permitted to count all of the energy storage projects funded partially through the Self-Generation Incentive Program.  Mara and Bass discussed the PD's determination that the load-serving entity of the customers installing energy storage projects should retain the storage credits.  Mara and Bass stated that AReM and the DAC Coalition have proposed that the customer that invested in the energy storage project be able to assign the energy storage procurement ""credit"" to the LSE. Mara and Bass discussed the PD's determination regarding the Power Charge Indifference Amount (PCIA), and explained that all PCIA policy issues should be addressed uniformly in Track 2 in this rulemaking. Mara explained that the PD erred in stating that the Commission would determine the PCIA cost recovery period for the IOUs' 2014 energy storage solicitations in the separate proceedings addressing the IOUs' applications.  Mara requested that the PD be revised to correct that error."

Peterman, in San Francisco.  Also present was CC Song, Regulatory Analyst for MCE.  MCE representatives voiced concerns regarding the language within the Proposed Decision which would continue to limit SGIP-funded ES deployment to only being countable towards the Investor-Owned Utilities' (IOUs) ES procurement targets. MCE expressed its concern that the continued prohibition of Community Choice Aggregator's (CCAs) abilities to count SGIP-funded ES deployment towards their procurement targets, would likely lead to stagnation in the development of customer-side ES market segment. MCE reminded the Commission of MCE's collaboration with the College of Marin and Tesla Motors Inc. to install on-site ES. MCE representatives stated this resource will be located on the premises of a MCE customer within MCE's service territory, yet MCE is not presently able to claim credit for the development of this resource towards its ES procurement target, per Decision 13-10-040. MCE staff questioned whether there may still be a middle-ground solution that would allow both IOUs and CCAs to count of SGIP-funded ES resources towards their procurement targets."
