Rechtschaffen. TURN representatives discussed the Commission’s review of the Wildfire Mitigation Plans due to be filed by California electric utilities on February 6, 2019. TURN stated its interest in a Wildfire Mitigation Plan proceeding that results in utility service that is safe, reliable and affordable. TURN stated that it is encouraged by Administrative Law Judge Thomas’s January 17 Ruling directing that the Wildfire Mitigation Plans include the TURN template segregating existing compliance requirements already reflected in Commission approved rates and new or discretionary proposals that have not yet been approved by the Commission. TURN representatives, however, stated that it is mindful that the plans that the Commission adopts will become compliance requirements, subject to penalty, against which utilities will be measured by an independent evaluator. TURN recommended that this proceeding also focus on nuts and bolts issues, like clarification of operational practices and procedures, inspection protocols, emergency preparedness and response, and performance metrics and monitoring. TURN noted that the abbreviated time schedule and compliance requirements, leave R.18-10-007 an insufficient forum for the review and approval of new major spending programs."
