Dan Skopec, Vice President of Regulatory Affairs for SDG&E, participated in both meetings.  Blattner stated that SDG&E's Vehicle-Grid Integration (VGI) proposal and settlement were designed to be responsive to state policies and Commission guidance.  Blattner expressed concern that the Proposed Decision does not clearly provide for ongoing operations and maintenance.   Skopec indicated that such costs should be recorded and recovered in future rate proceedings.  Blattner stated that parties who claim that the model is invalid because it uses illustrative data are creating a Catch-22 where a program cannot be approved without data, but data cannot be generated without a program. Blattner also suggested that the proposed customer segment and location quotas are inconsistent with prior Commission guidance. In the meeting with Tisdale, Blattner also explained that demand response is essentially embedded within the VGI rate which benefits all ratepayers."

Corey described PG&E’s DC fast charger proposal. Johnson stated that restrictive allocations of EV charger site locations, like a 50/50 split between workplaces and multi-unit dwellings, would be difficult to implement and could slow the deployment of needed EV chargers. Johnson stated that more EV pilots are not needed. Written material (attached to the notice) was used. "

Baak discussed overlapping issues between the Alternative Fuel Vehicles (AFV), Distribution Resource Planning (DRP), and Integration of Distributed Energy Resource (IDER) proceedings. Baak described Vote Solar's concerns about the misalignment between investor owned utility (IOU) revenue motivation and the goals of the DRP and greenhouse gas emission reductions. Baak suggested EV charging station programs and pilots include integration capacity analysis results as one of the site selection criteria, that IOUs evaluate other forms of DER to mitigate infrastructure upgrades, and implement demonstration or pilot programs to test new revenue models."

Also present were Rajan Mutialu, Senior Analyst at ORA, and Marcel Hawiger, Staff Attorney at the Utility Reform Network, and Don Kelly, Executive Director of the Utility Consumers' Action Network, collectively ""the Ratepayer Advocates.""  The Ratepayer Advocates recommended the Commission to reject the proposed Settlement Agreement regarding San Diego Gas & Electric Company's Vehicle-Grid Integration (VGI) Pilot Program and reinstate the briefing schedule on the Application. The Ratepayer Advocates noted that unlike SDG&E's proposed settlement, the proposed settlement in SCE's application was an all-party settlement, and that it provided a much better model for developing utility EV infrastructure. If the Commission does not reject the proposed SDG&E Settlement Agreement, then the Ratepayer Advocates requested hearings on new factual issues raised by the modifications to the VGI program introduced in the proposed Settlement Agreement. Written materials (attached to the notice) were used."

Peterman, Administrative Law Judges Moosen, Wong, and Hieta, and Jennifer Kalafut, advisor to Cmmr.  Peterman, in San Francisco.  Andrea Tozer, Senior Attorney, SCE, also spoke at the meeting.  Kjaer discussed issues related to the alternative-fueled vehicle proceedings, including: (1) consolidation of the proceedings is not necessary or appropriate; (2) pilot programs should be approved without delay, and should test different models in different service areas; and (3) marketing, education, and outreach might be an appropriate topic to be addressed in workshops in the Rulemaking proceeding. Tozer stated that although the record in A.14-04-014 was well developed and addressed many issues relevant to all the proceedings, the record in that proceeding is not sufficient to adjudicate SCE's Charge Ready application (A.14-10-014), because SCE was not a party to A.14-04-014."
