(Sunrun), met with Rachel Peterson, Anand Durvasula, and Joanna Gubman, advisors to Cmmr. Randolph, in San Francisco. Sunrun representatives emphasized that behind-the-meter (BTM) storage providers can benefit all utility customers by providing substantial clean, local and customer-driven capacity in ways that can meet various grid services needs such as resource adequacy (RA) and distribution deferral. Sunrun explained that several policy barriers are restraining the ability for this capacity to be cost-effectively provided to the market. Sunrun clarified that the nearest term way to allow for BTM storage systems to be aggregated and deliver additional valuable energy services is to ensure that exports from BTM storage systems qualify for RA capacity credit. Sunrun supported collaboration between the Commission and the California Independent System Operation (CAISO) to modify the CAISO’s Proxy Demand Response market mechanism to allow for exports or changes in the RA rules. Sunrun stated that it would also support load modification constructs that would allow exports to reduce a load serving entity’s RA obligation. Sunrun generally discussed other concerns encountered in recent grid services solicitations."

Peterman was present.  Ms. Rigatti mentioned that Southern California Edison Company (SCE) supports cost-effective decarbonization and innovative approaches in support of that goal. Ms. Rigatti discussed SCE’s proposed Clean Energy Optimization Pilot as an approach that provides performance-based incentives to reduce greenhouse gases through energy efficiency, storage, and other technologies. Ms. Rigatti mentioned SCE’s Clean Power and Electrification Pathway, and that electric vehicles and utilities play an important role in achieving the State’s climate goals to reduce GHG emissions, nitrous oxides, and particulate matter, including by expanding distributed energy resources, transportation electrification, and building electrification. Ms. Rigatti stated that SCE is building charging infrastructure needed to make this a reality and explained that significant infrastructure to support away-from-home charging is necessary to meet the charging station need and enable charging at times when there is abundant renewable energy."

Also present were Mark Esguerra, Director, Grid Integration; for PG&E, and Diana Genasci, Senior Advisor, Regulatory Affairs, and Douglas Snow, Director, Revenue Requirements and Tariffs, for SCE. The Joint Utilities discussed issues regarding the January 8, 2018 Proposed Decision (PD) on Track 3 Policy Issues, Sub-Track 1 (Growth Scenarios) and Sub-Track 3 (Distribution Investment and Deferral Process) issued within the Distribution Resources Plan (DRP) proceeding (R.14-08-013). The Joint Utilities indicated that the framework outlined in Decision (D.) 16-12-036 in the Integrated Distributed Energy Resources (IDER) proceeding (R.14-10-003) appropriately accounts for cost recovery consistent with general ratemaking principles. PG&E indicated that it may be able to incorporate distributed energy resources (DERs) in its upcoming General Rate Case (GRC) and asked for flexibility to track DER payments in its GRC. The Joint Utilities discussed the Grid Needs Assessment (GNA) and Distribution Deferral Opportunity Report (DDOR). The Joint Utilities recommended that in its initial stages, the scope and content of the GNA and DDOR should consist of established concepts and existing distribution planning practice. The Joint Utilities recommended that the Distribution Deferral Planning Advisory Group (DPAG) be focused on advising the utilities and not on developing its own contingency plans or choosing non-consensus projects. The Joint Utilities stressed the need to keep market sensitive cost information confidential or provide flexibility for the utilities to present a cost estimate range. Written materials consisting of copies of the formally filed documents (the PD and comments on the PD) were used."

ORA explained that the use of the same GHG price for both distribution and transmission resources was necessary to achieve the IRP goal of meeting GHG targets at the lowest cost to ratepayers, and that there was no factual basis to assign different carbon abatement values for different resources.

Among other things, PG&E, SDG&E and SCE stated that the Commission should exercise this authority to modify or reject CCA and/or ESP IRPs if they do not satisfy statutory and Commission requirements. PG&E, SDG&E and SCE also proposed three suggested revisions to the PD."

Picker, in San Francisco. Also present were Tim Drew and Shelly Lyser, public utilities regulatory analysts, and Matt Miley, Staff Attorney, for the ORA. ORA representatives discussed issues regarding the January 8, 2018 proposed Decision on Track 3 Policy Issues, Sub-Track 1 (Growth Scenarios) and Sub-Track 3 (Distribution Investment and Deferral Process) (PD), issued on January 8, 2018 in the Distribution Resources Plan (DRP) proceeding, Rulemaking (R.) 14-08-013. ORA indicated its support for the PD’s prohibition on double recovery of costs for Distributed Energy Resource (DER) deferral projects, and noted that the ratemaking treatment for DER deferral projects adopted in Decision (D.) 16-12-036 is narrowly applicable to the Integrated DER pilots and, therefore, not binding for the DRP Track 3 Decision. ORA noted its support for the PD’s adoption of the Grid Needs Assessment (GNA) report and the Distribution Deferral Opportunity Report (DDOR) and recommended that the PD be modified to clarify the GNA and DDOR process. A written material (attached to the notice) was used."

Mr. Campbell summarized the cost recovery provisions of D.16-12-036, the Decision’s assumptions concerning cost recovery, and ORA’s comments articulating the potential for double recovery. Ms. Lyser detailed the new facts that warranted ORA’s Petition for Modification of D.16-12-036. Ms. Lyser highlighted the direct overlap between Southern California Edison Company’s (SCE) proposed Distributed Energy Resources pilots and its current General Rate Case (GRC) application as well as Pacific Gas and Electric Company’s proposed pilot and approved GRC application. Ms. Lyser also noted that Energy Division’s Draft Resolution E-4889 recognizes the double recovery issue in SCE’s pilot proposals. Ms. Lyser reiterated ORA’s recommendations to address this issue and detailed how it could be applied going forward."
