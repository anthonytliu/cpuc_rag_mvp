AReM supports the 17% PRM without waivers as a more equitable solution that protects affordability  and  reliability  and  also  expressed  its  support  for  continuing  efforts  to  improve  modeling to achieve consensus on the PRM necessary to achieve a 0.1 loss of load expectation AReM also discussed  its  support  for  hourly  obligation  trading,  stating that hourly obligation trading provided load serving entities flexibility to achieve compliance with slice-of-day obligations cost-effectively while protecting reliability.
