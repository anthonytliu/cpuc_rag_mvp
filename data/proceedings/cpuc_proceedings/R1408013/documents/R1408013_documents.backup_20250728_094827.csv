Picker, in San Francisco.  Representatives from the California Energy Storage Alliance, the California Solar and Storage Association, Stem, Community Solar Access, Tesla, Inc., Sunrun Inc. and SEIA participated in the meeting by way of teleconference. The parties representatives discussed their concerns regarding the position that has been taken by the investor owned utilities (IOU) regarding the confidentiality of distribution system planning data. The parties representatives discussed how such a broad interpretation of what is confidential makes it very difficult to craft a non-disclosure agreement that creates workable provisions for parties to operate under, especially as it exposes the recipient of information to potential liability for revealing information that is in fact already in the public domain. The parties representatives noted that with the IOUs being under a Commission directive to release the Integrate Capacity Analysis maps and data by the end of the year, the need to reach resolution on the confidentiality issue was pressing."

(Sunrun), met with Rachel Peterson, Anand Durvasula, and Joanna Gubman, advisors to Cmmr. Randolph, in San Francisco. Sunrun representatives emphasized that behind-the-meter (BTM) storage providers can benefit all utility customers by providing substantial clean, local and customer-driven capacity in ways that can meet various grid services needs such as resource adequacy (RA) and distribution deferral. Sunrun explained that several policy barriers are restraining the ability for this capacity to be cost-effectively provided to the market. Sunrun clarified that the nearest term way to allow for BTM storage systems to be aggregated and deliver additional valuable energy services is to ensure that exports from BTM storage systems qualify for RA capacity credit. Sunrun supported collaboration between the Commission and the California Independent System Operation (CAISO) to modify the CAISO’s Proxy Demand Response market mechanism to allow for exports or changes in the RA rules. Sunrun stated that it would also support load modification constructs that would allow exports to reduce a load serving entity’s RA obligation. Sunrun generally discussed other concerns encountered in recent grid services solicitations."

The Joint IOUs representatives discussed security issues regarding the public availability of the Solar Photovoltaic (PV) and Renewable Auction Mechanism (RAM) maps. PG&E stated that it has been observing cyber security threats to its PV RAM map data which has been increasing since the issue was first deliberated upon in 2011. The Joint IOUs noted that they were interested in protecting the grid by limiting bad actors from obtaining the information and had no intention of limiting access to verified good actors. The Joint IOUs proposed to require users of the maps to register on a secure web portal and sign a non-disclosure agreement which does not deviate from the norm adopted by the Commission and other stakeholders for other security-sensitive and confidential information. The Joint IOUs noted that restricting access to PV Maps would be consistent with other more recent actions taken by the Commission and the approach by other state and federal agencies. The Joint IOUs sought updated protocols from the CPUC contemplating cyber and physical security risks and proposed a short-term interim solution."

At the meetings also present were Christian Knierim, Public Utilities Regulatory Analyst, and Matt Miley, Staff Attorney, for the ORA. At the meeting with Candace Morey also present was Christopher Myers, Public Utilities Regulatory Analyst, for the ORA. During both meetings, ORA discussed the proposed Decision Denying the Application of Southern California Edison (PD), which was issued in Application (A.) 16-11-002. ORA noted that Southern California Edison Company (SCE) asks the Commission to take judicial notice of the California Energy Commission’s (CEC) California Energy Demand (CED) Update Forecast 2016-2027 and CED [Revised] Forecast 2018-2030 for the alleged factual truth that the PRP RFO 2 resources may be needed to address a load increase of approximately 720 MW in the Western Los Angeles (LA) Basin by 2021. ORA asserted that that factual matter is in dispute and by law, judicial notice should not be granted. ORA pointed out that the CEC’s CED forecasts do not focus on the Western LA Basin, but rather the entire LA Basin. ORA discussed relevant information regarding one of the contracts that SCE claims will support its Distribution Resources Plan (DRP) Demonstration Projects (Demo) C in Rulemaking 14-08-013 et al. ORA explained that the record does not support the purported viability of one of the contracts for the purposes of Demo C. In the meeting with Ehren Seybert, ORA also discussed several claims made in a letter in support of SCE’s Application that was served on the service list for A.16-11-002 on April 20, 2018 by the non-party Center for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Technologies."

ORA also discussed two Notices of Ex Parte Communication that were recently filed in A.16-11-002 by entities that are not parties to that proceeding: (1) the notice filed by Convergent Energy and Power, LP on April 2, 2018 (Convergent Notice), and (2) the notice filed by Swell Energy Inc. on April 3, 2018 (Swell Notice). ORA noted that the Convergent Notice and the Swell Notice both contain attachments that are formally captioned as “Comments” on the PD. ORA emphasized that the Convergent Notice and the Swell Notice do not indicate that their respective “Comments” on the Proposed Decision were not accepted by the Commission’s Docket Office and, therefore, are not part of the record. ORA stated that it finds this activity to be misleading to the Commission and the public.  Written material, attached to the notice, was used."

ORA noted that the cumulative cost of the PRP RFO 2 contracts that SCE proposes to use for its DRP Demo D is significant, and SCE’s request is therefore inconsistent with (1) the Commission’s determination in D.17-02-007 and (2) SCE’s June 17, 2016 comments in the DRP proceeding that it does not anticipate requiring additional procurements to support Demo D.

ORA pointed out that in D.17-02-007 the Commission rejected SCE’s request to extend its Demo D schedule to accommodate PRP RFO 2 resources, and that SCE’s statement in its December 4, 2017 ex parte notice that “one PRP contract could enable SCE to study a circuit with 160% [Distributed Energy Resource] penetration” is unsupported by the record evidence. Finally, ORA noted that (1) the Commission provided the utilities the opportunity to increase their DRP Demo cost caps and SCE does not appear to have requested a cost increase for Demo C or D, and (2) SCE proposed and the Commission, in D.17-02-007, authorized the utilities to procure resources for the DRP Demos and request approval of the resources via a Tier 3 advice letter process.

ORA discussed Southern California Edison Company’s (SCE) Preferred Resources Pilot (PRP) Request for Offer (RFO) 2 (PRP RFO 2) and the Distribution Resources Plan (DRP) Demonstration (Demo) Projects C and D. ORA noted that the cumulative cost of the PRP RFO 2 contracts that SCE proposes to use for its DRP Demo C is well beyond the procurement cost cap that the Commission instituted in Decision (D.) 17-02-007 for SCE’s DRP Demo C. ORA noted that the cumulative cost of the PRP RFO 2 contracts that SCE proposes to use for its DRP Demo D is significant, and SCE’s request is therefore inconsistent with the Commission’s determination in D.17-02-007. A written material (attached to the notice) was used. "

SCE representatives discussed the PRP RFO2 proceeding and the related Distributed Resource Plan (DRP) Demonstration C and D projects. SCE noted that there were several contracts in the PRP RFO2 application SCE planned to use in its DRP demonstration projects. Specifically, for Demonstration C, designed to test the locational net benefits analysis methodology, SCE stated that it believes successful implementation of the project relies upon timely approval of a certain PRP contract. For Demonstration D, which is designed to study high DER penetration levels, SCE stated that it intends to use the PRP contracts to significantly augment the DER penetration in the study area. Finally, SCE stated that it believed leveraging PRP RFO2 contracts to reduce DRP procurement needs was the right thing to do, and noted the Commission’s own expression of appreciation for this approach in the DRP Track 2 Demo C and D decision issued in February."

Dr. Fine discussed broadly the progress made by the Integrated Capacity Analysis (ICA)/Local Net Benefits Analysis (LNBA) working groups, the fact that the working groups need to be diligent in following processes for establishing “consensus” positions that allow enough time for meaningful comment by stakeholders, and the fact that utility methodologies for ICA and LNBA need further refinement. In addition, Dr. Fine touched on EDF’s work in Fresno with the Rocky Mountain Institute Electricity Lab, Integrated Distributed Energy Resource utility revenue pilot and EDF’s alternative to that pilot, and the recent ruling in New York on utility business models."
